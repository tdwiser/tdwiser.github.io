*Note: The [SPCS High School Summer Institutes program](https://summerinstitutes.stanford.edu/) attracts outstanding high school students, is internationally competitive, and course material is comparable with university-level courses. Courses meet daily for three weeks and are ‘deep dives’ into challenging material.*

* Theory of Relativity (Summer 2016 and Summer 2017)
	- Three-week course in special and general relativity for high school sophomores and juniors. Created entire course with tightly integrated active learning exercises, completed by students in small groups. Course materials available at [LINK].
	- Textbook: Geroch, General Relativity from A to B; Taylor & Wheeler, Spacetime Physics
* Topics in Physics (Summer 2015)
	- Three-week intensive introduction to physics aimed at outstanding high-school freshmen. Planned and created all course material including lectures, ''clicker-style'' response questions, interactive group work, demonstrations, and labs.
