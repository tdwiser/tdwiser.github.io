## Theoretical Physicist

I am currently an Assistant Professor of Physics at Truman State University in Kirksville, Missouri.

I earned my Ph.D. in physics in 2016. My dissertation and primary research interests are at the intersection of theoretical and experimental particle physics and cosmology.

Here are some things I am interested in:

* [Dark matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03824)
* [Precision tests of gravity](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06273)
* Axions (and relaxions)
* Explication and communication of theoretical physics
* Equity, inclusion, and diversity in physics

<!-- ## Science Education Fellow

My current role is in curriculum development and teaching at Stanford. I help implement "course transformations"---mainly converting lecture-based courses to interactive ones---and co-teach the transformed courses with faculty.

Characteristics of transformed physics courses at Stanford typically include:

* Emphasis on active student engagement, rather than passive lectures
* [Skill-focused learning goals](http://stanford.edu/~tdwiser/p61/files/learning_goals.pdf) (e.g. "able to X" instead of "understand Y")
* [Individual and small-group activities](/portfolio/sample-course-materials-physics-61), designed to practice targeted skills
* [Problem sets](http://stanford.edu/~tdwiser/p61/files/hw_guidelines.pdf) that incorporate revision based on feedback, and function as practice, not assessment
* A supportive and collaborative, not competitive, environment -->
