Research Interests
==================
Theoretical particle physics emphasizing conception and design of new, non-collider experimental tests for physics beyond the Standard Model (especially dark matter, long-distance behavior of gravity, and solutions of the electroweak and strong CP naturalness problems); finding testable predictions of new physics models that are well motivated by experimental or theoretical considerations. My research is at the intersection of theory and experiment, and of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.
