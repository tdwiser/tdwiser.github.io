`physhandout` is a package, or rather collection of three packages, that provides a workflow for creating and organizing active-learning course handouts in LaTeX.

Key features:

* Content-keyed organization of course materials in a single LaTeX project with packages and macros shared across documents
* Automatic numbering and cross-referencing of handouts
* Inline solution macros to produce 'fillable' versions of handouts and their solutions from the same source
* Compatible with both local command-line tools (`make`/`latexmk`) and collaborative web-based editors (e.g. Overleaf)

You can grab `physhandout` or its consitutent packages `handouts` and `solution` [from GitHub](http://github.com/tdwiser/physhandout).
